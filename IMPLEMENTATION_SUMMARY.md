# Implementation Summary: Railway Complaint Management System Updates

## Overview
This document summarizes all the changes implemented to meet the following requirements:

1. Change hash ID pattern from `PlatformNumberQRNumber` to `(Platform Number/QR Number)`
2. Change "Recent Complaints" to "Active Complaints"
3. Remove Station Information tab from Closed complaint tab
4. Auto-refresh dashboard every 24 hours for active complaints
5. Auto-close complaints after 24 hours
6. Display redundant complaint numbers on dashboard
7. Add Support button/form for technical assistance

## 1. Hash ID Pattern Update

### Changed Files:
- `railwork/complaints/models.py`

### Changes:
- Updated `PlatformLocation.generate_hash_id()` method to generate format `(Platform Number/QR Number)` instead of `P{platform}{sequence}`
- Updated model field help text to reflect new format: `(1/1), (1/2), (2/1)` instead of `P11, P12, P21`
- Increased `max_length` from 10 to 15 characters to accommodate new format
- Created management command `update_hash_ids.py` to migrate existing data

### Example:
- Old format: `P11`, `P12`, `P21`
- New format: `(1/1)`, `(1/2)`, `(2/1)`

## 2. "Recent Complaints" â†’ "Active Complaints"

### Changed Files:
- `railwork/complaints/templates/complaints/dashboard.html`
- `railwork/complaints/templates/complaints/user_dashboard.html`

### Changes:
- Updated all instances of "Recent Complaints" text to "Active Complaints"
- Changed navigation tab labels
- Updated section headers in both admin dashboard and user dashboard

## 3. Removed Station Information from Closed Complaints Tab

### Changed Files:
- `railwork/complaints/templates/complaints/user_dashboard.html`

### Changes:
- Added conditional logic `{% if active_tab != 'closed' %}` around the Station Information card
- Station Information section now only displays on the "Active Complaints" tab
- Closed complaints tab shows only the complaints table without station details

## 4. Auto-refresh Dashboard (24 hours)

### Changed Files:
- `railwork/complaints/templates/complaints/user_dashboard.html`

### Changes:
- Added JavaScript block that automatically refreshes the page every 24 hours (86,400,000 milliseconds)
- Auto-refresh only activates on active complaints tab, not on closed complaints tab
- Uses `setTimeout()` to trigger `window.location.reload()` after 24 hours

## 5. Auto-close Complaints After 24 Hours

### New Files:
- `railwork/complaints/management/commands/auto_close_complaints.py`

### Changes:
- Created Django management command to automatically close complaints older than 24 hours
- Command finds all non-closed complaints created more than 24 hours ago
- Sets `is_closed=True`, `closed_at=current_time`, and `closed_status=current_status`
- Includes `--dry-run` option for testing
- Can be scheduled to run daily via cron job

### Usage:
```bash
# Test what would be closed
python manage.py auto_close_complaints --dry-run

# Actually close the complaints
python manage.py auto_close_complaints
```

## 6. Display Redundant Complaint Numbers

### Changed Files:
- `railwork/complaints/templates/complaints/dashboard.html`
- `railwork/complaints/templates/complaints/user_dashboard.html`

### Changes:
- Enhanced complaint number display to show parent/child relationships
- Parent complaints now show: `<complaint_number> [Parent] (X redundant)`
- Child complaints show: `<complaint_number> [intensity_count]`
- Added redundant count display next to first complaint row in both dashboards

### Display Logic:
- If complaint has parent: Shows intensity badge with child number
- If complaint has children: Shows "Parent" badge + "(X redundant)" text
- Regular complaints: Show normally without badges

## 7. Technical Support System

### New Files:
- `railwork/complaints/templates/complaints/support_form.html`
- `railwork/complaints/models.py` (SupportRequest model)

### Changed Files:
- `railwork/complaints/views.py` (added support_request view)
- `railwork/complaints/urls.py` (added support URL)
- `railwork/complaints/admin.py` (added SupportRequest admin)
- `railwork/complaints/templates/complaints/user_dashboard.html` (added support button)

### Features:
- **Support Request Model**: Tracks support tickets with priority, category, status
- **Support Form**: Comprehensive form with station info auto-filled
- **Email Notifications**: Automatically emails technical team when request submitted
- **Admin Interface**: Full admin panel for managing support requests
- **Support Button**: Prominently placed in station information section

- Steps to Reproduce (optional textarea)

### Admin Features:

## Database Migrations

### Created Migrations:
- `0014_alter_platformlocation_hash_id_supportrequest.py`
  - Updates hash_id field max_length and help_text
  - Creates SupportRequest model with all fields and relationships

### Migration Commands:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py update_hash_ids  # Updates existing hash IDs to new format
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Apply Database Migrations**:
   ```bash
   cd railwork
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

2. **Update Existing Hash IDs** (if you have existing data):
   ```bash
   python manage.py update_hash_ids --dry-run  # Preview changes
   python manage.py update_hash_ids            # Apply changes
   ```

3. **Schedule Auto-close Command** (optional):
   Add to crontab to run daily:
   ```bash
   0 2 * * * /path/to/python /path/to/manage.py auto_close_complaints
   ```

4. **Configure Email Settings** (for support notifications):
   Update `settings.py` with proper email configuration:
   ```python
   EMAIL_HOST = 'your-smtp-server.com'
   EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@domain.com'
   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-password'
   DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'system@railwork.com'
   ```

## Testing

All changes are backward compatible and can be tested in the following order:

1. **Hash ID Format**: Create new platform locations and verify they use `(X/Y)` format
2. **Active Complaints**: Verify tab labels and section headers updated
3. **Station Info Hiding**: Switch to closed complaints tab and confirm station info hidden
4. **Auto-refresh**: Wait on active complaints tab and confirm page refreshes after 24 hours
5. **Support Form**: Click support button, fill form, verify email sent and admin entry created
6. **Redundant Display**: Create parent/child complaints and verify count display
7. **Auto-close**: Run management command and verify old complaints are closed

## Support Contact

For technical issues with these implementations, use the new Technical Support form accessible from the station manager dashboard.
